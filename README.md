We certainly always try to speed up the creation of code, two of the most commonly used methods<br>
we use are:<br>
* Adapt/Tweak/Re-use code<br>
* Emmet abbreviations that expands on full code/code snippets<br>

If the only option we have is to create code starting from the scratch, then Emmet is the tool to be used<br>
Emmet is and Add-on available for several text editors (Vscode, Sublime, Atom, etc.)<br>
It's already included on Vscode so everytime a valid abbreviation (built-in/custom) is recognized<br>
you'll see kind of a suggestion telling you that a Emmet abbreviation is available<br>
then you can press TAB to expand it, see images below:<br>
